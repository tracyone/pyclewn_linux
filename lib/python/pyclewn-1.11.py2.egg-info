Description: Pyclewn allows using Vim as a front end to a debugger.
        The debugger output is redirected to a Vim window, the pyclewn console.
        The debugger commands are mapped to Vim user-defined commands
        with a common letter prefix, and with completion available on the
        commands and their first argument. The controlling terminal of the
        program to debug is the terminal used to launch pyclewn, or any other
        terminal when the debugger allows it.
